Feature: Add Picture to an Item
  As a user
  I want to upload a picture when creating an item
  So that I can associate an image with the item

  Scenario: User successfully uploads a picture for an item
    Given I am a logged-in user for item creation
    When I visit the new item page to add a picture
    And I fill in the item-specific field "Name" with "Laptop"
    And I fill in the item-specific field "Value" with "1200"
    And I select a bin
    And I attach a file "spec/fixtures/files/item_picture.jpg" to the item picture field
    And I click the item button "Create Item"
    Then I should see the item success message "Item was successfully created"
    And I should see the uploaded item picture
